Shaun Aguirre-Reyes 11/04/22 Reverse It instructions

The way this program works is it takes the user input and it will reverse any word you input. To run it you would open the file by copying the link from github, then open a new Visual Studio Code. You click on the "Clone Git Repository" and a search bar type of thing pops up on the top of the page. You then paste the code you copied from github into that bar and you clone it from URL. Then after you do that all of the code pops up from whoever git you copied from. Once opened you can start debugging the program and when you do that it will automatically open a web page window. It never works however you do want to copy the URL from the web page it opened. Next you want to open Postman and open a new page to where you see it says "Enter Request URL" and paste the copied URL into that bar. after you had to add "/" to add the routes into the bar as well. So something like "https://localhost:7110/reverseit/reverse/Shaun". As you can see it has the copied URL as well as the routes and the commands. When you run that in Postman it should give you something like "nuahS" or whatever name you choose to enter.
